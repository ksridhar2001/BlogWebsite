                        <p>
                            Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff 
                            and D. B. Weiss for HBO. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's 
                            series of fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. The show was both produced 
                            and filmed in Belfast and elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Filming locations also included 
                            Canada, Croatia, Iceland, Malta, Morocco, and Spain. The series premiered on HBO in the 
                            United States on April 17, 2011, and concluded on May 19, 2019, with 73 episodes broadcast 
                            over eight seasons.

                            Set on the fictional continents of Westeros and Essos, Game of Thrones has several plots 
                            and a large ensemble cast and follows several story arcs. One arc is about the Iron Throne 
                            of the Seven Kingdoms and follows a web of alliances and conflicts among the noble dynasties 
                            either vying to claim the throne or fighting for independence from it. Another focuses on the 
                            last descendant of the realm's deposed ruling dynasty, who has been exiled and is plotting a 
                            return to the throne, while another story arc follows the Night's Watch, a brotherhood defending 
                            the realm against the fierce peoples and legendary creatures of the North.

                            Game of Thrones attracted a record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, and international 
                            fan base. The series was acclaimed by critics for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, 
                            and production values, although its frequent use of nudity and violence (including sexual violence) 
                            was criticized; the final season received further criticism for its condensed story and creative 
                            decisions, with many considering it a disappointing conclusion. The series received 58 Primetime 
                            Emmy Awards, the most by a drama series, including Outstanding Drama Series in 2015, 2016, 2018, 
                            and 2019. Its other awards and nominations include three Hugo Awards for Best Dramatic Presentation 
                            (2012–2014), a 2011 Peabody Award, and five nominations for the Golden Globe Award for Best Television 
                            Series – Drama (2012 and 2015–2018). In 2019, the show's final season established a new record for most 
                            Emmy nominations received in the same year by any regular series with 32, breaking the 25-year-long record 
                            of 26 nominations established by NYPD Blue in 1994; it also established Game of Thrones as the drama series 
                            with the most overall Emmy nominations, with a total of 161.

                                    In the continent of Westeros, Warden of the North Eddard "Ned" Stark becomes "Hand of the King" (chief adviser) to King Robert 
                                    Baratheon. When Ned's son Bran stumbles upon Queen Cersei having sex with her twin brother Jaime Lannister, Jaime attempts to 
                                    kill Bran but only succeeds in crippling him. Ned moves to King's Landing, the capital of the Seven Kingdoms, and discovers 
                                    that Robert Baratheon's heir Prince Joffrey and his siblings were in fact incestuously fathered by Jaime. When King Robert dies, 
                                    Ned does not recognize Joffrey as the rightful heir and is executed. Ned's bastard son Jon Snow joins the Night's Watch, an ancient 
                                    brotherhood sworn to watch over the massive Wall in the North, which separates the Seven Kingdoms from hostile tribes known as 
                                    "Wildlings" and mythological humanoid creatures known as "White Walkers". In the continent of Essos, the exiled Viserys Targaryen, 
                                    son of King Aerys who was deposed by King Robert, marries off his sister Daenerys to the Dothraki warlord Khal Drogo, in exchange 
                                    for an army to return to and take over Westeros. Eventually Drogo kills Viserys and Drogo later dies himself. After Drogo dies, 
                                    Daenerys manages to hatch three dragons.

                                    Ned's oldest son Robb has declared war on the Lannisters and holds Jaime prisoner. However, his mother Catelyn secretly frees Jaime 
                                    to ransom her daughters, Sansa and Arya, believed to be captives in King's Landing. Sansa is being regularly abused by her betrothed 
                                    King Joffrey, while a disguised Arya escapes Lannister forces in Harrenhal. Ned's ward, Theon Greyjoy sides with his father and seizes 
                                    Winterfell, the Starks' ancestral home, though Bran and his brother Rickon escape. Meanwhile, Stannis and Renly Baratheon, brothers of 
                                    the deceased King Robert, claim the throne for themselves. Stannis has the support of Melisandre, a Red Priestess of the Lord of Light. 
                                    Stannis kills Renly and attacks King's Landing, whose defense is successfully led by Tyrion Lannister, the acting Hand of the King and 
                                    Queen Cersei's younger brother. On a foray beyond the Wall, Jon Snow manages to gain the trust of Wildlings, while other members of the 
                                    Watch come under attack by an army of White Walkers and their reanimated corpses. In Essos, Daenerys and her khalasar find refuge in Qarth. 
                                    After foiling an attempt to steal her dragons, Daenerys leaves the city.

                                    also betrays the Starks. After Robb's death, Lord Roose Bolton is appointed the new Warden of the North by Lord Tywin Lannister, the head of
