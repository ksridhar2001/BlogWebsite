                        <p>
                            Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime drama television series 
                            created and produced by Vince Gilligan. The show aired on AMC from 
                            January 20, 2008 to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for 
                            a total of 62 episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque, New Mexico, 
                            and tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), an underemployed and 
                            depressed high school chemistry teacher who is struggling with a recent diagnosis 
                            of stage-three lung cancer. White turns to crime, partnering with his former student 
                            Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by producing and selling crystallized methamphetamine to 
                            secure his family's financial future before he dies, while navigating the dangers of 
                            the criminal underworld. The title is a Southern colloquialism meaning to turn to a life 
                            of crime.Gilligan characterized the series as showing Walter's transformation from 
                            a soft-spoken Mr. Chips into Scarface.

                            Breaking Bad is widely regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time.[9] It had moderate 
                            viewership in its first three seasons, but the fourth and fifth seasons saw a significant rise in viewership 
                            when it was made available on Netflix just before the fourth season premiere. By the time that the series finale 
                            aired, it was among the most-watched cable shows on American television. The show received numerous awards, 
                            including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards, eight Satellite Awards, two Golden Globe Awards, two Peabody Awards, two Critics' 
                            Choice Awards, and four Television Critics Association Awards. Cranston won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding 
                            Lead Actor in a Drama Series four times, while Aaron Paul won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor 
                            in a Drama Series three times; Anna Gunn won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series 
                            twice. In 2013, Breaking Bad entered the Guinness World Records as the most critically acclaimed show of all time.

                                    The first season was originally intended to be nine episodes, but due to the 2007â€“2008 Writers Guild of America strike 
                                    only seven episodes were filmed.[23] It ran from January 20 to March 9, 2008.Walter, diagnosed with inoperable lung cancer, 
                                    conspires with Jesse to cook methamphetamine ("meth") as a way to pay for his treatment and provide financial security for his 
                                    family. Jesse secures a recreational vehicle to cook in, while Walter devises a production route using unregulated chemicals, 
                                    creating a highly pure product tinted blue. After a run-in with the Mexican drug cartel, Walter adopts the name "Heisenberg", 
                                    with his "blue sky" meth his signature product. Hank and the DEA become aware of this new figure in the drug trade and begin their

                                    After the death of Gus, Walter, Jesse, and Mike start a new meth business. When their accomplice Todd kills a child witness during 
                                    their theft of methylamine, Jesse and Mike sell their share to Declan. Walter produces meth for Declan, and Gus' former associate 
                                    Lydia starts distribution in Europe, which is so successful that Walter earns US$80 million, which he buries on the Tohajiilee Indian 
                                    Reservation. Hank attempts to prove Walter is Heisenberg. Walter kills Mike when he demands his share of the money and hires Jack's gang 
                                    to kill Mike's associates and Jesse. The gang turns on Walter, kills Hank, captures Jesse, and takes most of Walter's money. Walter uses 
                                    the remainder to escape to New Hampshire.

                                    Walter intends to surrender, but changes course after Elliott and Gretchen minimize his involvement in starting Gray Matter. 
                                    He leaves his money in a trust which Elliott and Gretchen would administer for his children. He confesses to Skyler that he dealt drugs 
                                    because he liked it. At Jack's compound, Walter kills Jack and the rest of his gang with a remote controlled machine gun and frees the 
                                    imprisoned Jesse, who kills Todd. Wounded in the aftermath, he asks Jesse to kill him, but Jesse refuses and departs. Walter reminisces 
                                    in Jack's meth lab and eventually dies.
